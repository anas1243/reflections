What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pos:
    	only the make sense changes are commited;
    	history will not be full of unneeded commits that results in the difficulty
    	 of reading.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    //Fill in your answer here

    because git is made as a code supported version control and sometimes we may need
     to change two dependent different functions in different files!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
